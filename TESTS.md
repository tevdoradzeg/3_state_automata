*Interactivity Tests*

1. Any color can be chosen and drawn.
2. Colring a pixel the same color does not make a change.
3. The board can be interacted with during an active running animation.
4. Every pixel within bounds can be colored.
5. Clicking outside the bounds does not give an error.

*Simulation Tests*

1. Pressing "Apply Step" accurately simulates the chosen rule.
2. Automatic animation can begin and stop at any moment by pressing pause/stop buttons.
3. Switching a rule while the animation is running actually switches the rule.
4. Filling the board does not stop the simulation.
